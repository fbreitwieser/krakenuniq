  env. variables
* added kraken-translate for getting taxonomic names for each sequence
* added a --rebuild option to kraken-build
* turned off default name checking for PE reads; added --check-names option
* added plasmids to --download-library options
* added HTML manual, redirecting README to that

v0.10.4-beta:

* enable input via stdin (via /dev/fd/0)
* enable compressed (gzip/bzip2) input
* enable auto-detection of fasta/fastq/gz/bz2
* simplified add_to_library.sh code to speed up large additions
* use RNA genomes for viral genome library
* scan .ffn (RNA) files for genomic data when building databases
* handle paired-end reads with --paired option
* provide MetaPhlAn-compatible output with kraken-mpa-report
* added domain/kingdom codes to kraken-report

v0.10.3-beta:
* remove Fatal.pm use in kraken-report
* fixed false success message on make failure in installer
* explicitly require g++ as C++ compiler in Makefile
* change to quickfile.cpp to do proper syncing on close
* fixed kraken-build bug w/ --work-on-disk (cause of some major build stalls)
* changed hash size calculation to use Perl

v0.10.0-beta:
* added CHANGELOG
* fixed quick mode hit list output
* updated README citation
* changed minimizer sort order (query speedup), changes database structure
